its a live stream network that you can get rewards at any given momemt for simply wearing the small camera in public. on the app you can locate the canera and see real time places all over the workd. needs permisson to enter non public locations. privacy rights as much as you taking a picture with people in the back ground.Thats allowed in public. This cuts crime, solves and helps the most unsolved cases, it lets you see a place for travel, i call it the wondering eye project!! auto pics up wifi as it nears free hotspots, you can sign up your hot spot to be picked up and be rewarded. its a free camera that anyone can access. its likw your always being protected and so much more. so many angles for markets,and new sub markets. this wondering eye is completely optional and can be turned on or off. its up to the individual to share the code yo the word or share the code to just family and friends.  with the wondering eye someone always sees you and you can interact with messages with anyone. 
this one guys i have started up by research but need to get data all over and run tests and product development. This is going to change lives. it makes the world a better and safer place.
